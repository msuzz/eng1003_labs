# Python code for ENGG1003 labs

This is the Python code for the lab tasks of the ENGG1003 (Introduction to Procedural Programming) course I did in the first semester of my Computer Systems Engineering degree at the University of Newcastle.

Unsurprisingly, I got a mark of 98% for the course, as I had plenty of programming experience from that ungodly App::MD5Tool perl module I created years earlier.
